Hi, I am Jerry. A student pursuing a Computer Science degree in University of Waterloo and a Business Administration degree in University of Wilfrid Laurier at the same time. I have two internship experience with a financial company and a technology start-up, and am going to work as an application developer the coming winter. Beside my passion in my career, I am also a well-rounded person: I excel at playing piano, enjoy swimming, and play some decent chess. To complete my profile, my parentage is nothing to sneeze at: as a descendant of a doctor and a business executive, I have been well taught to be show excellent etiquette and respect.

All bullshit aside, I am just a hedonist, someone who loves money. One who goes to college just to be better at earning money, and chooses Business specifically for this manner; who wishes to make money by lying on the couch; who dreams of traveling, eating, and shopping all at the luxury level. As for family and friends—they are also important—not because they can fulfill my psychological/social needs, but because such network will be beneficial when I encounter obstacles in life.

Now, if you are still unsure what kind of person I am, cross out everything you have just read. I am who I am: I do what I want, say what I like, and most importantly, treat others the way they do to me. #equality
