Jerry Wei

###Intro###

My name is Jerry Wei. I'm a junior in math major at Calrton college, a liberal art school in Northfield, Minnesota.

I like Japan (obviously). I enjoy watching anime and reading manga. Seafood and meat are my favorite, and I think food
is very important during a trip, especially when I know I will go back to that small town and eating junk food for another
term. 

I went to Japan in summer, 2014 with another friend. We went to kyoto, osaka and nara, and saw many ancient temples and wooden buildings there.
My friend knew Japanese, so that I don't have any trouble when I want to communicate with others. This time is different as all four of us cannot
speak or understand Japanese very well, so it would be a challenge for us. I hope we can have a memorable and safe exploration in this beautiful Asian country.
